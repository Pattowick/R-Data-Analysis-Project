## <span style="color:blue"><b>TOTO</b></span>


TOTO is a legalised form of lottery sold in Singapore that involves the drawing of numbers at random for a prize. While many countries ban any form of gambling including lottery, Singapore, known for its rigid legal system, legalised several forms of gambling, including lottery (TOTO, 4D, and Singapore Sweep), horsing racing, and sports betting. 

TOTO was established in 1968 as a state-controlled channel of gambling to fight widespread illegal gambling in Singapore. Prior to 7th October 2014, it adopted a ‚Äò6 out-of 45‚Äô format. With a minimum betting amount of 50 cents, a buyer picks at least six numbers, from 1 to 45. The winning numbers drawn include six numbers plus an additional number. The game is played on every Monday and Thursday in Singapore. If the numbers chosen match at least three numbers and the additional number drawn, the player wins a prize.

For instance, if the player picked numbers 2, 7, 9, 14, 23 and 30, and the winning numbers drawn are: 2, 9, 14, 23, 30, 41 plus additional number 7, the player will win a prize for the 5+1 category (for matching 5 out of 6 winning numbers, and the additional number drawn). 

The winners will get a share of the prize pool for each draw (‚ÄúPrize Pool‚Äù). The Prize Pool shall be an amount equal to fifty-four per cent (54%) of the net amount of total stake collection of that draw less the Goods and Services Tax thereon . Please refer to Exhibit 1 for the shares of the prize pool by different prize groups. 

If there is more than 1 winner in a prize group, the prize amount will be divided equally among all winners. (Applicable to Group 1, 2, 3 and 4). 


## <span style="color:blue"><b>Snowballing of Prize</b></span>

In 1981, snowballing was introduced to TOTO. It worked as the following:

‚Ä¢	If there is no winner in Group 1 to 4, the prize amount will snowball (i.e. it gets added to the next draw prize amount). <br>
‚Ä¢	Group 1 Prize will snowball up to 4 draws, whereas, the Group 2, 3 and 4 will snowball until they are won. <br>
‚Ä¢	If there is no winner for 4 consecutive draws, the Group 1 Prize will cascade to the Group 2 Prize, to be shared equally among the winners. <br>
‚Ä¢	If there is no winner in Group 2, it will cascade to the next Group until there is a winner. <br>
‚Ä¢	Cascading only applies to Group 1 Prize.

## <span style="color:blue"><b>Bet Types</b></span>

Players can bet on TOTO in the following ways:

‚Ä¢	Ordinary Entry: This is the most basic bet. Each Ordinary Entry costs $0.50. <br>
‚Ä¢	System Entry: Select more than 6, and up to 12 numbers from 1 to 45. E.g. System 7 bet is a selection of 7 numbers. System 8 has 8 numbers, and so on. <br>
‚Ä¢	System Roll: Select 5 numbers from 1 to 45. The last number is represented by ‚ÄòR‚Äô, covers the remaining 40 numbers. <br>
‚Ä¢	QuickPick: The computer randomly selects numbers from 1 to 45.

## <span style="color:blue"><b>Assumptions üí°</b></span>

1. We are only analyzing winners from Group 1
2. Dataset only covers from <u>1997 to 2014</u>; GDP Per Capita dataset covers from 1990 to 2020
3. Sample Betting Number only provides Punters Bet Combination on <u>1997-08-14</u>
4. Betting Amount is taken as the revenue since Group1.Prize is derived from the total bet amounts by all the bets placed by punters 
(Neglecting any cost to run Toto System or other sources of revenue)
5. Only 1 Bet Type is assumed in this analysis - <b> Ordinary Bet </b>

#### <i>It does suggest unfairness in the drawn numbers, but take note the dataset only runs until right before the change in Toto system from 1-45 to 1-49. Therefore there are fewer numbers in 40s, making the occurence of 40s being picked look significantly lower</i>

### Interpreting Multiple Linear Regression Result

| Finding                                     | Evidence                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| üìâ November has lowest betting volume       | Significant (p = 0.0161)      |
| üìâ July also lower bets                     | Significant (p = 0.0469)      |
| üìâ Months 9‚Äì12 show near-significant dips   | Suggest seasonality           |
| ‚ùå Jackpot size, winners, GDP have no effect | Not significant               |
| ‚úÖ Culture/habit/seasonality is key          | Suggest Possibility of such influence|

Since from Month 1 - 12, the linear regression takes Month 1 as the benchmark reference hence Month 11 shows statistically significance in the betting volume being significantly lower as compared to Month 1 suggesting the possibility of seasonal/habit/culture betting behaviors from Punters. As also supported from Month 9-12 as well as no statiscal significance in Jackpot Size, No.of Winners and growth in GDP.

Similar to previous Multiple Linear Regression since this is just taking the raw bets which the results are as expected. However this regression result is susceptible to outliers and may be noisier compared to previous transformed regression.

### Interpreting Multiple Linear Regression Result

| Variable       | Effect on `bettingamount` | Interpretation                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Group1.Prize` | +\$1.007 per \$1          | Basically defines `bettingamount` ‚Äî **not an independent variable**           |
| `snowball1‚Äì3`  | Strong negative           | Rollovers inflate prize, but lower **fresh revenue** seen that draw           |
| `Month8`, `10` | Positive, significant     | More betting activity ‚Üí higher revenue in Aug and Oct                         |
| Other months   | Small effects             | Suggest seasonality but not strong enough to stand on their own statistically |
| `GDP`, `Year`  | No significant impact     | Consistent with earlier models                                                |

Before any interpretation, it is important to duly note that the <b>target variable is derived and assumed</b> that the Group1.Prize is the total revenue that Toto receives. (Group1.Prize = Revenue aft deducting snowballed amount). However, before each draw, the total betting amount are <u>totaled and distributed into groups</u> as shown in the table provided at the start. <b>Group1 Prize only consist of 33% of the Prize Pool.</b>

| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Circularity / Tautology**      | The target variable (`bettingamount`) is derived directly from `Group1.Prize`. The model is explaining a variable using itself, which inflates model fit. |
| **2. Misleading Proxy for Revenue** | `Group1.Prize` represents only \~33% of the prize pool and doesn‚Äôt reflect total bet revenue, making it an unreliable measure of punter activity.         |
| **3. Multicollinearity**            | Strong correlation between predictors (e.g. `Group1.Prize` and `snowball`) can lead to unstable estimates and inflated standard errors.                   |
| **4. Game Structure Bias**          | Toto‚Äôs payout system is complex, with pooled prizes and multiple winning groups. Modeling only Group 1 ignores these structural dynamics.                 |
| **5. Heteroskedasticity**           | The variance of residuals may not be constant, especially during snowball periods, which violates linear regression assumptions.                          |
| **6. GDP & Year Irrelevance**       | Including predictors with no explanatory power (like GDP per capita or Year) introduces noise and adds unnecessary complexity.                            |





## <span style="color:blue"><b>Conclusion</b></span>

Based on the analysis, several key observations emerge ‚Äî keeping in mind the limitations of the dataset and the assumptions of fairness in the game design. The results suggest that Toto betting behavior is driven less by rational economic factors and more by cultural, seasonal, and habitual patterns.

In particular, GDP per capita, prize pool size, number of winners, and snowball effects showed no statistically significant relationship (p > 0.05) with the number of bets. Instead, seasonal effects ‚Äî particularly around festive periods like Chinese New Year ‚Äî show consistent influence, aligning with the demographic composition of Singapore, where Singaporeans of Chinese ancestry make up over 75% of the resident population.

This reinforces the idea that Toto functions not just as a lottery game, but as a social and cultural fixture, especially for regular and seasonal punters. To maintain or increase engagement, Toto may benefit from designing new game formats, special seasonal draws, or promotional events that tap into habitual and festive betting behaviors throughout the year.

While the 2016 revamp ‚Äî increasing the number pool from 1‚Äì45 to 1‚Äì49, and doubling the minimum bet ‚Äî aimed to raise prize amounts and excitement, Toto should continue to monitor its impact and adapt over time. As public awareness around gambling risks grows and younger generations adopt more skeptical views, Toto will need to evolve to remain relevant without encouraging problem gambling.

Finally, it is important to recall that Toto was originally introduced as a legal alternative to illegal gambling in Singapore. If it fails to remain engaging or credible, punters may seek alternative, unregulated avenues ‚Äî undermining the very objective Toto was created to serve.


For educational purposes, a Toto simulation was posted on Reddit by user: Rekane
https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/al5q7p/i_updated_the_toto_simulator/

After playing with the simulator, it is more often that we land ourselves in a huge debt before we can even live to the day we hit a jackpot assuming we bet everyday. Even if System 12 Bet is played, there's a chance the jackpot cannot cover the loss or that the profit only comes in after 44 years (If lucky)
