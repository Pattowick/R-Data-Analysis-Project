## 1. Importing Relevant Libraries
```{r}
#Importing all relevant libraries
library("ggplot2")
library("png")
library("gifski")
library("gganimate")
library("dplyr")
library("RColorBrewer") #Used in Plot 2
library("ggcorrplot") #Used in Plot 7
library("lubridate") #Used in Plot 8

```

## 2. Reading and Understanding the Dataset
```{r}
kickstarter <- read.csv("./Dataset/Lesson 7 Dataset/kickstarter.csv")
head(kickstarter,1)

# Noted Problem 1: created_at & deadline & launched_at are in character but they are dates

kickstarter_col <- colnames(kickstarter) #To decide which variables to analyze
# kickstarter_col 
```
### Question 1: Which project categories are the most and least popular among Kickstarter Creators? (Plot 1)
```{r}
# Which project categories are the most and least popular among Kickstarter Creators?

#Setup for plot (D)
ksplot1 <- kickstarter %>% group_by(maincategory) %>% summarise(Count=n()) %>% mutate(fill_color= case_when(
                                                                                            Count == max(Count) ~ "green",
                                                                                            Count == min(Count) ~ "red",
                                                                                            TRUE ~ "beige"
                                                                                            ))
#Establishing Plot 1 with adjustments
plot1 <- ksplot1 %>% ggplot(aes(x=maincategory,y=Count,fill=fill_color)) + geom_bar(stat='identity') + coord_polar(clip= "off") +scale_fill_identity() +labs(title="Kickstarter Projects by Main Category", x="Main Category",y = "Number of Projects") +geom_text(aes(label = Count), color = "black", size = 3, nudge_y=300) +

  ) 

```
### Question 2: Among all the projects in Kickstarter, what proportion does each states take up? (Plot 2)
### Question 3: What is the rate of success for each maincategory? (Plot 3)
### Question 4: Top 5 Countries that are highly participative in Kickstarter (Plot 4)
```{r}

```
### Question 5: Which 5 countries are participating actively in Kickstarter and what categories are successful for them? (Plot 5)

```{r}
# Which 5 countries are participating actively in Kickstarter and what categories are successful for them?

top5<- countryshare$country[1:5]

kickstarter$countrycopy <- ifelse(kickstarter$country %in% top5, kickstarter$country, "Rest")

plot5 <- ggplot(ksplot5, aes(x=reorder(maincategory,success_rate),y=success_rate)) +geom_bar(stat='identity') +coord_flip() +facet_wrap(~countrycopy)


# Make plot5 stand out more and easier to distinguish

num.categories <- length(unique(ksplot5$maincategory))

```
### Question 6: Does higher backer count lead to higher success rate? (Plot 6)
### Question 5.2: Top 3 Sub Categories that are successful among each maincategory (Plot 5_alt)
```{r}
# Does higher backer count lead to higher success rate?

plot6 <- kickstarter %>%

```{r}
# Correlation Matrix to show which factors affect success rate
